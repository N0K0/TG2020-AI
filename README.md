# The Gathering 2020 AI competition: Gaia Edition

The SpaceCrew wants to save money on training personnel while also maintaining the same military prowess.
Quite a bit of discussion later the SpaceCrew figured that they should try using some sort of AI for controlling the smaller ships they brought along.
After the event with Mother in 2019 the SpaceCrew do not want to use any of the existing General purpose AI Technology they have invented. No need to lose yet an other planet to some "helpful" robot.
This is where you come in, your mission is to start the work on an specialized AI that should be able to control our spaceships hopefully without ending with us having to escape from GAIA too..
